    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "To achieve this, we employ advanced machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, leveraging a diverse dataset of labeled music samples spanning different genres with various features. We will also compare among different algoritms' performances to ensure the system's accuracy, robustness, and ability to generalize across a wide range of music styles."
