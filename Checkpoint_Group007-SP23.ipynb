    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "The project is designed to be a Music Genre Classification Tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study aims to develop an advanced music genre classification system with the objective of enhancing personalized recommendation mechanisms and user experience. The comprehensive classification model is capable of accommodating a wide spectrum of music genres, such as rock, pop, jazz, hip-hop, and electronic, among others. The dataset comprises audio recordings of songs, evaluated through an array of attributes such as spectral information, rhythmic patterns, and harmonic characteristics, along with mean and variance of multiple features in CSV files. These extracted features serve as input for our machine learning models. Employing algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks, the research exploits a heterogeneous dataset of labeled music samples spanning various genres. The efficacy of the proposed music genre classification system is gauged through numerous evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. These quantitative assessments shed light on the models' classification performance and their capability to accurately predict music genres, enabling the selection of the most efficient model. By demonstrating high accuracy and robustness, our tool exhibits its effectiveness and dependability, promising significant improvements in music recommendation systems."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Music genres are categories that have arisen through a complex interplay of cultures, artists, and market forces to characterize differences between compositions and performances. They can reflect the cultural origins of the music, the style, the instrumentation used, the mood it conveys, or even the time period when it was produced. For example, the genre of classical music, the more ancient style, is known for its sophisticated orchestral composition and large musical scales. On the other hand, genres like rock and pop, which emerged more recently, have their distinct characteristics: rock typically features a strong backbeat along with electric guitars, while pop music often has catchy and repetitive melodies and a verse-chorus structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is focused on developing a state-of-the-art music genre classification system that optimizes the way music platforms and music companies design their personalized recommendation systems to improve overall music listening experience and user experience through a more precise way of avigating and discovering music. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we employ advanced machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, leveraging a diverse dataset of labeled music samples spanning different genres with various features. We will also compare among different algoritms' performances to ensure the system's accuracy, robustness, and ability to generalize across a wide range of music styles."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "The problem our project seeks to address is the accurate categorization of music tracks into their respective genres. Precise music genre classification is a complex and multifaceted challenge due to the inherent subjectivity involved in music perception and the overlapping elements present across various genres. Yet, accurate genre classification is paramount to improving user experience on music platforms, as it plays a crucial role in personalized music recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project tackles this problem through the lens of supervised machine learning. With a dataset of songs with labeled genres and an array of song features, we aim to train a model that can accurately predict the genre of a song, even with unseen data. Our goal is to devise a machine learning model that optimizes precision and generalization while minimizing overfitting."

    "In general, the solution will be the following in steps:\n",
    "1. Data Processing: We will begin by pre-processing our dataset. This involves handling missing data, dealing with outliers, and possibly transforming variables as necessary to make them appropraite to use.\n",
    "2. Feature Selection: We will choose chroma_stft, rms, spectral_centroid, spectral_bandwidth, roll_off, zero_crossing_rate, harmony, perceptr, tempo, mfcc(1-20) to determine the genre of songs. Since we can't get those data in every frame or seconds, so we just get their mean and variance for future usage.\n",
    "3. Model Training: We will utilize KNN, SVM, and Neural Networks (if possible) to train our models, adjusting parameters to find the most optimal configuration for each model.\n",
    "4. Model Evaluation and Selection: We will evaluate each model's performance using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. The model that performs the best across all metrics will be selected as our final model.\n",
    "5. Testing on Unseen Data: Finally, we will test our selected model on unseen data to assess its ability to generalize and make accurate predictions on new data to ensure that it doesn't overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to be specific, we will talk about them in details:\n",
    "1. For algorithm of multi-class classification, we will use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks (If possible). We believe these methods are particularly suitable for our task due to their ability to handle high-dimensional data and flexibility in model complexity.\n",
    "2. The machine learning algorithms will be trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising multiple music genre samples, where each song is represented by an array of extracted audio features. The aim is to create a model that, given these features of a song, can predict its genre with high accuracy.\n",
    "3. For the library we may wanna use, we plan to implement our solution using Python and relevant libraries such as Pandas for data preprocessing, Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, and Matplotlib for data visualization.\n",
    "4. For benchmark comparison, we will use a simple classification model, like Logistic Regression. The performance of our machine learning models will be used to be against this benchmark model to assess their efficiency and accuracy."
